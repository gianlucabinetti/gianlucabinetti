## üîí **About Me**

I'm Gianluca Binetti, a Computer Science student at Florida Atlantic University, pursuing a minor in Artificial Intelligence. My focus is on cybersecurity, specifically in blue team roles, where I aim to develop advanced skills in threat detection and mitigation. I have hands-on experience with tools like Kali Linux, Suricata, and OpenVAS, and I've implemented projects in intrusion detection and DDoS mitigation. I'm also delving into Python and C++, as I'm passionate about systems engineering and software development, with a primary focus on securing systems. I'm actively working on enhancing my skills in cybersecurity defense and look forward to applying my knowledge to protect and secure digital environments.
